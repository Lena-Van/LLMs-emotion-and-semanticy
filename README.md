# Sentiment Analysis of LLM-Generated Content in Human-LLM Climate Change Discussions
## 📖 Description   
This project investigates how large language models (LLMs) handle emotional content and maintain semantic coherence in social media conversations.
Using both open-source and commercial models, we analyze their behavior in continuation and response tasks on climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit.
